  - Title
  - Rating
  - Short description
- Implement a movie detail screen displaying:
  - Image(s)
  - Name
  - Rating
  - Long description
  - Director
  - List of actors
  - Any other relevant details
- Use state management tools like Redux, Zustand, MobX, etc.
  
## Technologies Used
- React/React Native
- TypeScript
- Redux
- Native Base
